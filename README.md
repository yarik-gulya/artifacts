<h1>Artifacts: Magic, Myths & Legends</h1>

<p>Artifacts is an interactive digital gallery of legendary, mystical, and magical items drawn from fantasy, mythology, and imagination. Each artifact is a carefully crafted entry,
  combining lore, abilities, and activation methods to immerse visitors in a world of wonder.</p>

<p>“Some artifacts hold power. Others hold stories. These hold both.”</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>

<p>This project was created as a tribute to the ancient and the arcane — an artistic collection of fictional magical artifacts that
  feel like they could exist in fantasy novels, role-playing games, or lost legends.</p>

  <p>Whether you're a writer, game designer, fantasy fan, or just love mysterious relics, this site is meant to inspire and spark imagination.</p>

  <p>Each artifact includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A unique name and visual style</li>
    <li>Backstory or myth</li>
    <li>Special abilities</li>
    <li>Activation conditions</li>
    <li>Thematic symbolism</li>
  </ul>
